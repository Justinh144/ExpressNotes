Hello! Here is my submission for the express project.

I was unfortunently not able to figure out how to get the actual notes to save. I sadly have run out of time for this week to do this homework. I decided not be writing comments or a detailed readme for this project as I would like to return to it and finish it before the end of the course. I am still struggling with some of the concepts and would wait to turn it in but I do not wish to incur any late penalties. I will be updating and resubmitting soon, thank you for your understanding.
